# about-me
A short description about me.

# Who am I
Professionally, I am a QA engineer with aspirations to become a Security and Automation expert.
I've been in the workforce for roughly a year and a half. Nothing says 'real world' like living in
it.

# Who am I, really
A former fitness enthusiast turned faux chef. My main hobby is cooking making the kitchen my place of
zen.
I occasionally brew my own beer which has helped me grow significantly in the QA profession (nobody
likes bad beer).

# What is my purpose
I don't know yet. Why include this section? I am deep thinker. I like to sit and ponder. By nature I am
an observer.

# Will this README be updated
Yes. As a profressional, and a human, I have significant growth to look forward to. The revision history
will be a constant reminder of how hard I've worked in my own words.
